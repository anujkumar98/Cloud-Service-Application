# Cloud-Service-Application

### Designed and developed a microservices-architecture based web application using RESTful APIs to ensure high performance, scalability, and flexibility.
### The web application was deployed on custom DNS using AWS Route53, and load balancers were utilized to provide a highly available and fault-tolerant infrastructure. This setup allowed the application to handle a large volume of traffic, ensuring minimal downtime or disruptions for end-users.
### Implemented automation for AWS DevOps deployment for Packer and Terraform, which allowed for efficient infrastructure-as-code. Leveraged GitHub action ci/cd for continuous integration and deployment, which improved the overall development process and accelerated the release of new features and updates.
### Utilized Boto3 to interact with AWS S3 and RDS for image storage. This allowed for the efficient storage and retrieval of images within the application, which was critical for providing a smooth and seamless user experience.
### Logged application performance metrics through AWS CloudWatch, which helped to monitor and optimize the application's performance. This helped to identify potential bottlenecks and issues, allowing for proactive resolution and ongoing improvements.
